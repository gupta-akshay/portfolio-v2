## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` with these magical incantations:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_HOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=your_cloudfront_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PAIR_ID=your_cloudfront_key_pair_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_cloudfront_private_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=your_ga_measurement_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_APP_CODE=your_clarity_app_code
```

### 2. Analytics Setup üìä

This project uses Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity for basic usage analytics:

1. **Google Analytics**:
   - Create a GA4 property at [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
   - Get your Measurement ID (starts with 'G-')
   - Add it to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`

2. **Microsoft Clarity**:
   - Create a project at [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com)
   - Get your tracking code
   - Add it to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_APP_CODE`

> Note: These analytics tools are used solely to understand usage patterns and improve user experience. No personal data is collected or processed beyond standard analytics metrics.

### 3. Audio Files Setup üéµ

1. Create an S3 bucket:
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí S3
   - Create a new bucket
   - Block all public access (for security)
   - Enable CORS for your domains

2. Set up CloudFront (Optional but recommended):
   - Create a CloudFront distribution
   - Use your S3 bucket as origin
   - Set up Origin Access Identity (OAI)
   - Create a CloudFront key pair for signed URLs
   - Configure your bucket policy to allow CloudFront access

3. Create an IAM user:
   - Create a user with programmatic access
   - Attach a policy with these permissions:

     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Action": [
                     "s3:ListBucket",
                     "s3:GetObject"
                 ],
                 "Resource": [
                     "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                     "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
                 ]
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

4. Configure CORS for your S3 bucket:

   ```json
   [
       {
           "AllowedOrigins": [
               "http://localhost:3000",
               "https://your-domain.com"
           ],
           "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
           "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
           "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
           "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
       }
   ]
   ```

### 4. Audio File Naming üéµ

Name your audio files like this:

```text
[Year][Original Artist][Name][Type][Artist].mp3
Example: [2024][The Beatles][Hey Jude][Remix][A-Shay].mp3
```

> Pro tip: The brackets are important. Very important.

### 5. Fire It Up! üî•

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev    # For the yarn enthusiasts
# or
pnpm dev    # For the storage optimizers
# or
bun dev     # For the cool kids
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and marvel at your creation.
