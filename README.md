## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` with these magical incantations:

```env
# Email service (Required)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Sanity CMS (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_HOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here
# Optional: defaults to 2024-09-25 if not set
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-09-25

# Neon Database (Required for emoji reactions)
NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url_here

# AWS S3 + CloudFront (Required for music player)
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=your_cloudfront_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PAIR_ID=your_cloudfront_key_pair_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_cloudfront_private_key

# Analytics (Optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=your_ga_measurement_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_APP_CODE=your_clarity_app_code

# Rate limiting (Optional - falls back to in-memory if not set)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_token

# Base URL (Optional - defaults to localhost:3000)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Analytics Setup üìä

This project uses Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity for basic usage analytics:

1. **Google Analytics**:

  - Create a GA4 property at [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
  - Get your Measurement ID (starts with 'G-')
  - Add it to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`

2. **Microsoft Clarity**:
  - Create a project at [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com)
  - Get your tracking code
  - Add it to `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_APP_CODE`

> Note: These analytics tools are used solely to understand usage patterns and improve user experience. No personal data is collected or processed beyond standard analytics metrics.

### 3. Rate Limiting Setup üõ°Ô∏è

This project uses Upstash Redis for serverless rate limiting to prevent spam and abuse:

1. **Upstash Redis Setup**:
  - Create a free account at [Upstash](https://upstash.com)
  - Create a new Redis database
  - Copy the REST URL and REST TOKEN
  - Add them to your `.env.local` file

2. **Benefits**:
  - ‚úÖ 10,000 requests/day free tier
  - ‚úÖ Serverless and auto-scaling
  - ‚úÖ Perfect for Netlify/Vercel deployments
  - ‚úÖ Automatic failover to in-memory storage during development

3. **How it works**:
  - Contact form is limited to 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
  - **Atomic operations** using Lua scripts to prevent race conditions
  - Redis stores request counts with automatic expiration
  - **Fixed-window rate limiting** for consistent behavior
  - Graceful degradation to in-memory storage if Redis is unavailable
  - Clear error messages for rate-limited users with retry-after headers
  - IP extraction with proper proxy support

> Note: If you don't set up Redis, the system will fall back to in-memory storage (works fine for development but won't persist across serverless function calls in production).

### 4. Database Setup üóÑÔ∏è

This project uses Neon PostgreSQL for the emoji reactions feature:

1. **Neon Database Setup**:
   - Create a free account at [Neon](https://neon.tech)
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database
   - Copy the connection string
   - Add it to your `.env.local` file as `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`

2. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Generate migration files
   npm run db:generate
   
   # Apply migrations
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Benefits**:
   - ‚úÖ Serverless PostgreSQL with auto-scaling
   - ‚úÖ Perfect for Netlify/Vercel deployments
   - ‚úÖ Type-safe operations with Drizzle ORM
   - ‚úÖ Automatic connection pooling

> Note: The emoji reactions feature requires a database connection. Without it, the reactions won't persist.

### 5. Audio Files Setup üéµ

1. Create an S3 bucket:

  - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí S3
  - Create a new bucket
  - Block all public access (for security)
  - Enable CORS for your domains

2. Set up CloudFront (Optional but recommended):

  - Create a CloudFront distribution
  - Use your S3 bucket as origin
  - Set up Origin Access Identity (OAI)
  - Create a CloudFront key pair for signed URLs
  - Configure your bucket policy to allow CloudFront access

3. Create an IAM user:
  - Create a user with programmatic access
  - Attach a policy with these permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Configure CORS for your S3 bucket:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://your-domain.com"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

### 6. Audio File Naming üéµ

Name your audio files like this:

```text
[Year][Original Artist][Name][Type][Artist].mp3
Example: [2024][The Beatles][Hey Jude][Remix][A-Shay].mp3
```

> Pro tip: The brackets are important. Very important.

### 7. Fire It Up! üî•

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev    # For the yarn enthusiasts
# or
pnpm dev    # For the storage optimizers
# or
bun dev     # For the cool kids
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and marvel at your creation.

## üîÑ Version History

You can check out the older version built with Gatsby at [portfolio v1](https://github.com/gupta-akshay/portfolio) (Warning: Contains legacy code and nostalgia)
