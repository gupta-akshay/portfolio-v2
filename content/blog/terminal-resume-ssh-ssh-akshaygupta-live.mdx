## Introduction

Ever wish a resume said "hi" the same way you do? 🚀 This one does. Pop open iTerm (or whatever shell keeps you grounded), paste `ssh ssh.akshaygupta.live`, and a neon figlet banner blooms like it's 1994. In a blink you're welcomed with the TL;DR, a friendly prompt, and zero browser chrome in sight. It feels like stepping into a dotfiles stash, only this one tells my career story.

## How it works
Under the hood it's just thoughtful TypeScript, and a little flair. Here's the tour 🧭

- `terminal/server.ts` spins up an `ssh2.Server`, accepts every session and hands it off to a fresh `ResumeShell` so nobody fights for history or width.
- The shell clears the screen, renders the marquee welcome (`renderWelcome` mixes `figlet`, `gradient-string` and `boxen`), and reacts to `window-change` events so everything stays readable from 80 columns to ultrawide setups.
- Input flows through the `commander` map, so verbs like `summary`, `skills`, `experience`, `education`, `links`, `resume`, `clear`, and `help` are just plain object keys. Want a new section? Add another entry, done.
- Formatting magic lives in `terminal/renderer.ts`, where `wrap-ansi` keeps paragraphs tidy, `boxen` frames each section, and `chalk` paints the `akshay@terminal $` prompt with that unmistakable gradient.
- All copy comes straight from `terminal/resumeData.ts`, the same data powering `public/assets/akshay-cv.pdf`, which means the PDF, website, and shell stay perfectly in sync.

## How it is deployed

Setting it up locally is a five-minute coffee break ☕️: run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/akshay_terminal_host -N ""`, point `TERMINAL_SSH_HOST_KEY` at that file, and start `pnpm terminal:ssh`. It defaults to `0.0.0.0:2222`, but you can tweak `TERMINAL_SSH_HOST` and `TERMINAL_SSH_PORT` if your network has Opinions.

Production takes the same pragmatic path outlined in the README:
- `fly launch --no-deploy` to generate the Fly.io scaffolding from `fly.toml`.
- `fly volumes create keys_volume --size 1` so the Ed25519 host key survives restarts.
- `fly secrets set TERMINAL_SSH_HOST_KEY=/app/keys/terminal_host_ed25519` to wire up that volume.
- `fly deploy` to ship the container that just runs `pnpm terminal:ssh`.
- Allocate an IPv4 address, add an A record for `ssh.akshaygupta.live`, and keep Cloudflare in gray-cloud mode so raw SSH hits the box.

Not a Fly.io fan? Any tiny VM, Railway container, or Raspberry Pi that can run Node 18+ will do, just mount the host key somewhere durable and pass the same env vars.

## Conclusion

`ssh ssh.akshaygupta.live` is a little nostalgia and a lot of signal ✨. It stays in lockstep with the canonical PDF, feels snappy even on spotty Wi-Fi, and is genuinely fun to demo in interviews or hallway chats. Swap in your GIF captures, keep `resumeData.ts` updated, and you’ve got a living resume that greets people the same way you would, prompt first, attitude included.
